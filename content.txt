- About Me

I have been working and developing for about 5 years now. My professional focus is mainly on Web Design, Web Development, App Development, but I also enjoy experimenting in all the different areas that interest me, such as Game Development, IoT (Internet of Things), AI and so on. I guess I'm just a tech enthusiast :) I also have experience with Digital Marketing, having worked with SEM (Search Engine Marketing) and SEO (Search Engine Optimization). All these practices come together in any of my projects.
You can check my Github for more technical information on my projects or if you prefer you can contact me directly - I'm a quick replier ;)
I really enjoy jumping into new projects and make the most and best out of them, so if you would like to work together, give me a shout too!

As a developer, it doesn't matter if you would like to build a website, an app, or a web application from scratch, if you would like me to have a look and help your existing project, or even which programming languages you use. As I mentioned, I really enjoy diving into new projects and challenges and we can definitely have a chat on how we can help each other and add more value to your business. Count me in!
