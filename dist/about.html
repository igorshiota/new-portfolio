            I have been working and developing for about 5 years now. My
            professional focus is mainly on Web Design, Web Development, App
            Development, but I also enjoy experimenting in all the areas that
            interest me, such as Game Development, IoT (Internet of Things), AI
            and so on. I guess I'm just a tech enthusiast :) I also have
            experience with Digital Marketing, having worked with SEM (Search
            Engine Marketing) and SEO (Search Engine Optimization). All these
            practices come together in any of my projects. You can check my
            Github for more technical information on my projects or if you
            prefer you can contact me directly - I'm a quick replier ;)

              As a developer, it doesn't matter if you would like to build a
              website, an app, or a web application from scratch, if you would
              like me to have a look and help your existing project, or even
              which programming languages you use. I really enjoy diving into
              new projects and challenges and we can definitely have a chat on
              how we can help each other and add more value to your business.
              Count me in!

          <h3>Digital Salon</h3>
          <h6>Full Stack Developer</h6>
          <p>
            Working as a Full Stack Developer for Digital Salon I covered all
            aspects of the Web Development for the company: the front-end,
            back-end and system administration. We have used a wide range of
            resources, depending on the request and necessity. I have mainly
            worked with the Wordpress Content Management System and WooCommerce
            platform, working with Premium Themes and plugins or Designing it
            from scratch. In this case PHP has been mainly the back-end
            programming language, and the Web Server were configured and
            maintained at Digital Ocean.

          <h3>Freelance Work</h3>
          <h6>Web and Mobile App Development</h6>
          <p>
            I have also worked on a few stand alone projects and have created
            different templates for various audiences: Photographers,
            Restaurants, Hair and Beuty Salons, Marketing Agencies, and so on.
            On the Mobile App side I have created a few different apps for
            different purposes that include most of the main features asked in
            apps these days, such as a user registration, chat capabilities,
            push notifications, e-commerce shops, cart and checkouts, and so on.
            For these I have used the frameworks Angular, Ionic, and Laravel. I
            really enjoy experimenting with different technologies and see what
            they have to offer.

          <h3>Game Development</h3>
          <h6>Coding and Design</h6>
          <p>
            I have been working on personal Game Development projects for fun
            with the Unity Engine. I code (C#) and pick or create the assets
            myself. I really like the technical part of making a game as it is a
            great way to code in best practices and see everything coming
            together. You can check some of this work on my Github as well.
